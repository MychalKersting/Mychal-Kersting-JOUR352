    <h1>"Sticky Stuff" and Spin Rates</h1>
    <h2>Detailed Results of the Crackdown in 2021</h2>
    <h3>By Mychal Kersting</h3>
    
    <p>Pitchers in Major League Baseball thought the league's change in the new balls was one that did not benefit them. Pitchers lost grip on the ball, hence making    it harder for them to locate pitches properly. 
    
    <p>Pitchers were accused sticky substances, such as pine tar, a rosin/sunscreen combonation, and most infamously, spider-tack, to get control back. It worked, as pitchers became more dominant in a very short period of time. The league decided to crack down on all sticky substances in June of 2021.
        
    <p>Though nothing is proven the charts below, which exhibit the spin rates of three pitcher as the 2021 season progressed, show a correlation in the timing of the crackdown and the decrease of spin rates.</p>
