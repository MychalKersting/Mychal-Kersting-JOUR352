    <h1>"Sticky Stuff" and Spin Rates: Gerrit Cole</h1>
    <h2>Details the Results of the Crackdown in 2021</h2>
    <h3>By Mychal Kersting</h3>
    
    <p>Pitchers in Major League Baseball thought the league's change in the new balls    was one that did not benefit them. Pitchers lost grip on the ball, hence making    it harder for them to locate pitches properly. 
    
    <p>Pitchers decided to use sticky substances to get control back, and it worked as pitchers became more dominant in a very short period of time. The league decided to crack down on all sticky substances in June of 2021.
        
    <p> Gerrit Cole of the New York Yankees was being accused the loudest, and this chart shows his spin rates progressing through the season by pitch. The dip in spin rate after the crackdown in June suggests he was using something sticky to get a grip. </p>
